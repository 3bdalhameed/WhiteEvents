            Falling into events at an early age, Lara has been lucky enough to
            make a lifelong career of events and learned early on that weddings
            were her niche. Not only does Lara personally oversee every single
            aspect of each White Events wedding, sheâ€™ll also be the person who
            creates your wedding design and guides you through the wedding
            planning journey, with all the answers to your wedding questions.
